# stcli
stcli - a repl command line crypto wallet for stellar that is simple and all in oneÂ file

## Getting Started
If you have the Ubuntu you may be able to just clone the one file stcli.py
Everything resides in the one file... it will generate an stcli.conf in the same
directory or an encrypted stcli.zip


THIS APP is MADE FOR TESTING PURPOSES

* python

These libraries:
```

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/antb123/stcli.git
cd stcli
