# stcli
stcli - a repl command line crypto wallet for stellar that is simple and all in oneÂ python file

## Getting Started
If you have the Ubuntu you may be able to just clone the one file stcli.py
Everything resides in the one file... it will generate an stcli.conf in the same
directory or an encrypted stcli.zip.

The reason for this tiny app is I wanted a stellar wallet:
* written in python
* 100% auditable
* usable from a secured server
* for testing deposits and withdrawals
* fully command line text based 


THIS APP IS MADE FOR TESTING PURPOSES


### Prerequisites
Command line - preferably Linux but MacOS or Windows 10 with Linux should work
* python
* zip/unzip

These libraries:
```
toml>=0.9.4
prompt_toolkit>=2.0.3
requests>=2.13.0
stellar_base>=0.1.6
PyQRCode>=1.2.1
```

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/antb123/stcli.git
cd stcli
pip install -r requirements.txt
less stcli.py

Once you are satisfied it looks ok you can make it executable and then run it
chmod +x stcli.py
./stcli.py
type ? enter for help
```
